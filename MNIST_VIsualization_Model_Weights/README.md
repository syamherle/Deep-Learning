# Visualizing activation of layers for test data

+ Created a 5-Layer Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for MNIST handwritten digit dataset.
+ Trained a 5-Layer fully connected network (1024 hidden neurons) network using Adam optimization and Negative log-likelihood as loss function.
+ Applied PCA and tSNE on activation values of each layer of the test data to reduce test data dimension from (1024 x 1000) to (2 x 1000) where 1000 is the number of test data
+ Visualised the PCA and tSNE values using python MATPLOT and visualize the (classification o/p) cluster of the test data
